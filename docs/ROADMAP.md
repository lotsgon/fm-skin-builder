## Completed (this phase)

- Patch CLI with CSS-first workflow
- Scan/index CLI (optional) with `.uss` exports
- Change-aware bundle writes and debug exports
- Dry-run mode for patch

## Near-term priorities

- Improve docs with quick-start recipes (variables, selectors, dry-run, scan)
- Transparent caching of scan/index artifacts for speed (optional, no user action)
- Basic conflict surfacing UX (clear logs; optional opting to narrow targets via hints)

## Future

- Build-all command
- Swapper + verify
- GUI manager
- Web previewer
