# Exporting and Testing

Learn how to build your skin, install it in Football Manager, and iterate on your design.

## Building Your Skin

There are two ways to build your skin: Preview mode (for testing) and Full build (for installation).

### Preview Build (Recommended First Step)

Before doing a full build, it's smart to preview your changes:

1. Open FM Skin Builder
2. Select your skin folder
3. Click **"Preview Build"**
4. Switch to the **Logs** tab

**What happens**:
- FM Skin Builder analyzes your CSS and assets
- It shows you what would change without writing files
- You'll see a summary of affected bundles and textures

**Example preview output**:
```
✓ Successfully parsed config.json
✓ Loaded 2 CSS files
✓ Found 24 color variables
✓ Found 8 selector overrides
✓ Would modify 15 bundles
✓ Would replace 3 textures
✓ No errors detected
```

**Why preview first**:
- Catch CSS syntax errors before building
- Verify your changes will apply
- See warnings about potential conflicts
- Faster than a full build

### Full Build

Once your preview looks good, do a full build:

1. Click **"Build Bundles"**
2. Wait for the build to complete (usually 10-30 seconds)
3. Check the Logs tab for success confirmation

**Successful build output**:
```
✓ Build complete!
✓ Modified 15 bundles
✓ Replaced 3 textures
✓ Output: C:\Users\YourName\Documents\my-skin\packages\
✓ Build finished in 12.3 seconds
```

**Where are the files?**

Your built skin is in the `packages/` folder inside your skin directory:

```
my-skin/
├── config.json
├── colours/
│   └── base.uss
└── packages/              ← Your built files are here!
    ├── FMColours.bundle
    ├── UIStyles.bundle
    └── ... (more .bundle files)
```

These `.bundle` files are modified versions of FM's game files with your colors and assets applied.

## Installing Your Skin in Football Manager

Now that you've built your skin, let's install it in FM.

### Step 1: Locate FM's Skins Directory

Football Manager looks for custom skins in a specific location:

**Windows**:
```
C:\Users\[YourName]\Documents\Sports Interactive\Football Manager 2026\skins\
```

**macOS**:
```
~/Documents/Sports Interactive/Football Manager 2026/skins/
```

**Linux**:
```
~/.local/share/Sports Interactive/Football Manager 2026/skins/
```

If the `skins` folder doesn't exist, create it.

### Step 2: Copy Your Skin Files

There are two approaches:

**Option A: Copy the packages folder** (Simplest)

Copy your entire `packages/` folder into FM's skins directory:

```
Football Manager 2026/
└── skins/
    └── my-skin/          ← Create this folder
        └── (paste your .bundle files here)
```

**Option B: Use a descriptive folder name**

Rename `packages/` to your skin name before copying:

```
Football Manager 2026/
└── skins/
    └── dark-theme/       ← Your skin name
        └── (your .bundle files)
```

### Step 3: Activate Your Skin in FM

1. Launch Football Manager 2026
2. Go to **Preferences** (from the main menu)
3. Click on the **Interface** section
4. Find the **Skin** dropdown
5. Select your skin from the list
6. Click **Confirm**
7. FM will reload with your skin applied

**Tip**: Some changes may require restarting FM completely to take effect.

## Testing Your Skin

Now the fun part - seeing your changes in action!

### What to Check

**Colors**:
- Do your primary/secondary colors appear correctly?
- Check menus, buttons, and text
- Navigate different screens to see coverage

**Icons**:
- Do your custom icons appear?
- Are they the right size and quality?
- Check multiple locations where the icon appears

**Backgrounds**:
- Are background images positioned correctly?
- Do they tile or stretch as expected?

**Overall**:
- Is text still readable?
- Do colors have enough contrast?
- Does everything feel cohesive?

### Testing Different Screens

Make sure to test your skin across various FM screens:

- Main menu
- Squad screen
- Match day screens
- Tactics board
- Transfer screens
- Club info pages

Different screens may use different stylesheets, so colors might vary slightly.

## Iterating on Your Design

Skinning is an iterative process. Here's an efficient workflow:

### The Quick Iteration Loop

1. **Keep FM Skin Builder open**
2. **Edit your CSS files** in your favorite text editor
3. **Click "Preview Build"** to check for errors
4. **Click "Build Bundles"** once preview is good
5. **In FM, reload the skin**:
   - Go to Preferences → Interface
   - Switch to another skin, then back to yours
   - Or restart FM for guaranteed reload
6. **Check your changes**
7. **Repeat!**

### Pro Tips for Faster Iteration

**Use a text editor with auto-save**:
- VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++
- Changes are saved automatically
- Just hit "Build" in FM Skin Builder

**Work on one area at a time**:
- Don't change 50 colors at once
- Focus on buttons, then text, then backgrounds
- Easier to see what worked

**Keep notes**:
- Document which variables affect which UI elements
- Build a personal reference as you discover mappings

**Use debug mode when stuck**:
- Enable Debug Mode in FM Skin Builder
- Check the `debug/` output to see before/after stylesheets
- Helps identify why a color isn't changing

## Sharing Your Skin

Once you're happy with your skin, you might want to share it with others.

### What to Share

Share your **source files**, not just the built bundles:

```
my-skin/
├── config.json
├── colours/
│   └── base.uss
├── assets/
│   └── icons/
│       ├── star.png
│       └── mapping.json
└── README.md  ← Optional: Add usage instructions
```

**Don't share the `packages/` folder** - let users build it themselves with FM Skin Builder. This ensures compatibility and gives them the source to customize.

### Distribution Options

**Option 1: GitHub Repository**
- Create a repo with your skin folder
- Include a README with setup instructions
- Users can clone and build

**Option 2: ZIP Download**
- Compress your skin folder (without `packages/`)
- Host on file sharing site or forums
- Include a README with instructions

**Option 3: Community Sites**
- Share on FM community forums
- Include screenshots
- Provide FM Skin Builder instructions

### Include Instructions

Always include these instructions for users:

```markdown

## Troubleshooting Builds

### Build Succeeded but Nothing Changed in FM

**Possible causes**:

1. **FM didn't reload the skin**
   - Solution: Restart FM completely

2. **Files weren't copied correctly**
   - Solution: Verify your `.bundle` files are in FM's skins directory
   - Check you're not in a subfolder of `packages/`

3. **Your CSS variables don't match FM's variables**
   - Solution: Enable Debug Mode and check the exported USS files
   - See [Advanced Guide: Bundle Structure](/advanced-guide/bundle-structure)

4. **Cache issues**
   - Solution: Try rebuilding with cache refresh (see [Troubleshooting](/user-guide/troubleshooting))

### Colors Are Wrong or Inconsistent

**Check**:
- CSS syntax (missing semicolons, wrong hex format)
- Alpha channel values (transparency might be unexpected)
- Variable names (case-sensitive)

See the [Troubleshooting](/user-guide/troubleshooting) guide for more solutions.

## Advanced Testing Techniques

### Using Debug Mode

Enable Debug Mode in FM Skin Builder before building:

**What you get**:
- `debug/` folder in your skin directory
- Original USS files (what FM had)
- Patched USS files (what you changed)
- JSON structure files

**How to use it**:
1. Build with Debug Mode enabled
2. Look in `my-skin/debug/`
3. Compare `original/` vs `patched/` USS files
4. See exactly what changed

**Example**:
```css
/* original/FMColours.uss */
--primary: #3498db;

/* patched/FMColours.uss */
--primary: #ff0000;  ← Your change!
```

This confirms your CSS was applied correctly.

### A/B Testing

Compare your skin to FM's default:

1. Install your skin in `skins/my-skin/`
2. Switch between default and your skin in FM Preferences
3. Note which screens look different
4. Refine based on observations

## Performance Considerations

Skins built with FM Skin Builder have **no performance impact** on Football Manager:

- Bundle files are the same format as FM's originals
- No runtime overhead
- Colors are baked in at build time
- No scripting or dynamic processing

Your skin will run exactly as fast as the default FM skin.
