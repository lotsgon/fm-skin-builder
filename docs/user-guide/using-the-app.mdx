# Using the App

Learn how to use the FM Skin Builder desktop interface to build and preview your skins.

## The Desktop Interface

When you open FM Skin Builder, you'll see a clean interface with two main tabs:

1. **Build Tab** - Configure and build your skin
2. **Logs Tab** - View build output and progress

### Status Indicator

In the top-right corner, you'll see a status indicator:

- **Green dot**: App is ready (Tauri backend connected)
- **Yellow dot**: Preview mode (frontend only, limited functionality)

If you see a yellow dot, try restarting the app. Green means everything is working correctly.

## Build Tab

This is where you'll spend most of your time. Let's go through each section:

### 1. Skin Folder Path

**What it is**: The location of your skin folder on your computer.

**How to use it**:
- Click the **"Browse"** button to open a folder picker
- Or type/paste the full path to your skin folder
- Example paths:
  - Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\my-fm-skin`
  - macOS: `/Users/YourName/Documents/my-fm-skin`
  - Linux: `/home/yourname/Documents/my-fm-skin`

**What should be in this folder**:
Your skin folder should contain a `config.json` file at minimum. See [Editing Skins](/user-guide/editing-skins) for the complete folder structure.

### 2. Bundles Directory Path

**What it is**: The location of Football Manager's game files (Unity bundles).

**How to use it**:
- **Usually**: Leave this blank - the app will auto-detect FM's installation
- **Sometimes**: If FM isn't installed in the default location, click "Browse" to select it manually

**Common bundle locations**:

**Windows (Steam)**:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Football Manager 2026\data\
```

**Windows (Epic)**:
```
C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Football Manager 2026\data\
```

**macOS (Steam)**:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Football Manager 2026/data/
```

**Linux (Steam)**:
```
~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Football Manager 2026/data/
```

**Tip**: If you're not sure where FM is installed, check your Steam library or Epic Games launcher.

### 3. Debug Mode Toggle

**What it does**: Enables detailed debugging output when building your skin.

**When to enable it**:
- Your colors aren't changing and you want to see why
- You want to inspect the before/after stylesheets
- You're troubleshooting unexpected behavior

**What it creates**:
When enabled, the build process creates a `debug/` folder in your skin's output directory with:
- Original `.uss` files (what FM had before)
- Patched `.uss` files (what your changes produced)
- JSON files showing the internal structure

**Tip**: Only enable this when troubleshooting - it slows down builds slightly and creates extra files.

### 4. Preview Build Button

**What it does**: Runs a "dry run" of your skin build without actually writing any files.

**Why use it**:
- Check if your CSS will apply correctly
- See how many bundles will be modified
- Verify texture replacements before committing
- Quick validation while iterating

**How to use it**:
1. Fill in your skin folder path
2. Click **"Preview Build"**
3. Switch to the **Logs** tab to see the results

**What to look for in the output**:
```
✓ Successfully parsed CSS files
✓ Found 45 color variables
✓ Would modify 12 bundles
✓ Would replace 5 textures
```

The word "would" indicates this was a preview - nothing was written.

### 5. Build Bundles Button

**What it does**: Actually builds your skin and writes the modified files.

**How to use it**:
1. Fill in your skin folder path
2. (Optional) Preview first to verify
3. Click **"Build Bundles"**
4. Wait for the build to complete
5. Check the Logs tab for confirmation

**What happens**:
- Reads your CSS files and assets
- Loads FM's bundle files
- Applies your color changes
- Replaces textures (if you have any)
- Writes modified bundles to `<your-skin>/packages/`

**Build time**: Typically 10-30 seconds depending on your skin's complexity.

**Success looks like**:
```
✓ Build complete!
✓ Modified 12 bundles
✓ Replaced 5 textures
✓ Output: /path/to/your-skin/packages/
```

## Logs Tab

The Logs tab shows real-time output from the build process.

### Reading the Logs

**Green text**: Successful operations
```
✓ Successfully parsed config.json
✓ Loaded 3 CSS files
```

**Yellow text**: Warnings (non-critical)
```
⚠ Selector '.green' matched multiple stylesheets
⚠ Icon 'old_icon' not found in bundles
```

**Red text**: Errors (build failed)
```
✗ Error: config.json not found
✗ Failed to parse CSS file
```

### Common Log Messages

**"Auto-detected bundle directory"**
- Good! The app found your FM installation automatically

**"Using scan cache"**
- Good! The build will be faster because it's reusing previous scans

**"No changes detected"**
- Your CSS didn't produce any actual changes to the bundles
- Check your CSS syntax or variable names

**"Conflict: selector touches multiple assets"**
- A warning that one of your CSS rules affects multiple bundles
- Usually harmless, but see [Advanced Guide](/advanced-guide/config-and-mappings) for fine-tuning

### Clearing Logs

The logs persist across builds so you can compare results. To clear them, simply restart the app.

## Typical Workflow

Here's how most skinners use the app:

### First Time Setup:
1. Create your skin folder (see [Editing Skins](/user-guide/editing-skins))
2. Open FM Skin Builder
3. Browse to your skin folder
4. Click "Build Bundles"
5. Install the output in FM (see [Exporting and Testing](/user-guide/exporting-and-testing))

### Iterating on Your Skin:
1. Make changes to your CSS or assets
2. Click "Preview Build" to verify
3. If preview looks good, click "Build Bundles"
4. Test in FM
5. Repeat!

**Pro tip**: Keep FM Skin Builder open while you edit your CSS files. Just save your changes, then hit "Build Bundles" again. The app will automatically detect the changes.

## Tips for Faster Builds

1. **Use Preview Build**: Catch errors before waiting for a full build
2. **Keep debug mode off**: Only enable when troubleshooting
3. **Don't move your skin folder**: The app caches information based on the path
4. **Bundles auto-detect**: Let the app find FM automatically instead of manually specifying

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently there are no keyboard shortcuts, but you can navigate the interface with:
- **Tab**: Move between input fields
- **Enter**: Activate buttons
- **Ctrl+C** (in Logs): Copy log output

## What's Next?

Now that you know the interface, it's time to create your first skin!
