# User Guide

Welcome to the FM Skin Builder User Guide! This tool helps you create custom skins and themes for Football Manager 2026 using a CSS-first approach.

## What is FM Skin Builder?

FM Skin Builder is a desktop application that makes it easy to customize Football Manager's appearance. Instead of manually editing game files, you can:

- Define colors using familiar CSS syntax
- Replace icons and backgrounds with your own images
- Preview changes before applying them
- Build and export your skin with a single click

## What You Can Customize

- **Colors**: Change any color in the FM interface using CSS variables
- **UI Elements**: Override specific buttons, text, and component colors
- **Icons**: Replace game icons with your own PNG or SVG files
- **Backgrounds**: Add custom background images

## For FM24 Skinners

If you're familiar with Football Manager 24's XML-based skinning system, you'll find FM Skin Builder's CSS approach refreshingly familiar. We've designed it to feel similar to FM24's workflow while taking advantage of CSS's flexibility.

Check out the [Editing Skins](/user-guide/editing-skins) guide for a comparison between the XML and CSS approaches.
